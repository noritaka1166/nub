/// Terminating-signal forwarding to the current child, registered once per
/// process. Nub catches SIGINT (Ctrl-C), SIGTERM (docker stop / systemd / CI
/// cancel) and SIGHUP (terminal hangup) and re-sends the SAME signal to the Node
/// child, so the child runs its own handler and exits with the matching code —
/// instead of being reparented to PID 1 and running forever, which is what
/// happened when only SIGINT was handled. A single background thread reads the
/// current child's pid from a global atomic that each spawn updates, so
/// sequential / re-entrant spawns forward to the right child, and a stray signal
/// after a child exits (pid cleared to 0) is a no-op rather than a kill of a
/// reused pid.
///
/// The diagnostic signals SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 and SIGQUIT are forwarded too, for a
/// different reason than the terminating ones. Node assigns them meaning at the
/// child: SIGUSR1 activates the inspector / debugger, SIGUSR2 is the conventional
/// `--report-signal` trigger (and what tools like nodemon send), and SIGQUIT
/// reaches V8. Their DEFAULT disposition would terminate (SIGUSR1/USR2) or
/// terminate-and-core (SIGQUIT) the resident Rust PARENT — killing nub before the
/// child ever sees them. Registering a `signal-hook` handler for each overrides
/// that default disposition (the parent no longer dies), and the forwarder relays
/// the same signo to the child. Crucially, nub does NOT exit on these: unlike the
/// terminating set, nub keeps running and waits for the child after relaying, so
/// e.g. `kill -USR2 <nub>` writes a diagnostic report in the child and both
/// processes stay alive — exactly as if `node` had received the signal directly.
