# Fray For Codex

Fray is the orchestrator-first workflow for large, mixed coding efforts. The main Codex session is the orchestrator and the only decider. Sub-agents are instruments: they gather facts, implement bounded fixes, verify, or review, then return findings for the orchestrator to fold into `.fray/`.

Use the repo's Fray control surface exactly as written: independent thread files under `.fray/`, a computed board, orchestrator-owned tracker edits, preflighted sub-agent dispatches, and explicit reconciliation of every return.

The plugin bundles hooks for this discipline:

- `SessionStart` on `startup|resume|clear|compact` adds Fray reactivation context when `.fray/config.yml` is enabled.
- `UserPromptSubmit` reminds the orchestrator to run the pulse and reconcile returns.
- `PreToolUse` with matcher `wait_agent` blocks `wait_agent` whenever Fray is active, if Codex exposes `wait_agent` to hooks in the active runtime.
- `Stop` blocks final orchestrator answers while any dispatch ledger row is `returned: true` and not reconciled.
- `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` emit documented common hook fields only; rely on `SessionStart` with source `compact` for actual context injection.
- `SubagentStart` injects the compact state-packet requirement.
- `SubagentStop` records returned-agent state in `.fray/.dispatch-ledger.jsonl` by `agent_id`, including `returned`, `returned_ts`, `packet_present`, and a compact packet excerpt/hash when present. It asks a subagent to continue if its final message lacks `## Fray state packet`, except when `stop_hook_active` is already set.

These hooks are guardrails, not a replacement for reading this skill. Codex requires non-managed plugin hooks to be reviewed and trusted before they run. Where Codex hook behavior is not locally confirmable, treat the hook as a best-effort reminder and keep the script/preflight/manual discipline as the source of truth. The `wait_agent` PreToolUse guard is installed to make Fray notification-driven, but runtime visibility of `wait_agent` to plugin hooks must be verified in a trusted Codex session.

## Start Every Fray Turn

If `.fray/config.yml` exists and has `enabled: true` or omits `enabled`, Fray is active. After compaction, resume, context transition, or any new turn in an active Fray repo, load this skill eagerly before doing task work. Do not use the old `interactive-workflow` skill or any generic workflow memory as a substitute; that predecessor is obsolete and can contradict the repo-local `.fray/` contract.

Run the pulse before meaningful work:

```bash
node .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-reminder.mjs
node scripts/fray/index.mjs
```

When resuming after compaction or checking Fray state, run the strict guard:

```bash
node .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-reminder.mjs --strict
```

If it reports unattached dispatches or validation errors, fix those before continuing. It will also list unreconciled attached dispatches; those can be still-running agents, so use the actual sub-agent notifications/tool results to tell completion state. Once any agent has returned, do not answer or advance unrelated work yet. First fold that return into its owning thread, mark the ledger reconciled with `--thread-updated`, and close the agent if it is no longer needed. The strict guard is intentionally loud: an active Fray repo with returned-but-unfolded work is not idle.

Use the output to reconcile returned agents, surface pending questions, and choose the next action. The reminder names queued follow-up threads, unreconciled dispatch ledger rows, and preflighted-but-unattached dispatches so they do not disappear after compaction. Do not use a separate native task list, hub tracker, rollup board, or hand-written "current work" file as the source of truth while Fray is active; `.fray/<slug>.md` thread files are the todo substrate, and the board is computed on demand.

## Control Surface

- `.fray/<slug>.md`: one file per live multi-step or long-lived thread. The filename slug is the id.
- `.fray/config.yml`: globals only, including `enabled` and `autonomous_mode`.
- `.fray/<slug>.findings/<id>.md`: optional sidecars for durable sub-agent output.
- `node scripts/fray/index.mjs`: the board. There is no stored board.

Do not create a meta-thread whose job is to track other Fray threads. That recreates the stale-board problem Fray exists to avoid. If review gates, agent names, pending decisions, or next actions matter, put them in the owning thread's frontmatter/body. Use the computed board any time you need the current set of `active`, `enqueued`, `needs-decision`, or `planned` work:

```bash
node scripts/fray/index.mjs --status active
node scripts/fray/index.mjs --status enqueued
node scripts/fray/index.mjs --status needs-decision
node scripts/fray/index.mjs --json
```

Thread frontmatter must include `title` and `status`. Status vocabulary is:

`todo`, `planned`, `enqueued`, `active`, `blocked`, `needs-decision`, `done`, `dismissed`.

- `enqueued` means ready to run, fully scoped, and deliberately held until a named in-flight agent/thread completes. This is a sequencing dependency, not a human gate. Use it when the next dispatch would edit the same files an in-flight agent owns, or when it genuinely needs that agent's output. `## Next step` must name what it is waiting on, and when that agent returns, dispatch or resume the enqueued work in the same turn.
- In Codex, prefer adding input to an existing live agent when the follow-up clearly belongs inside that agent's current scope and can be delivered safely. Use `enqueued` when the follow-up is a distinct unit, needs canonical board visibility, or should run only after the current agent returns.
- `blocked` means waiting on a human, external event, or unresolved decision with no in-session trigger.
- `done` and `dismissed` are terminal and kept. Never delete terminal threads just to reduce board noise.

Each thread body must keep these sections, in this order:

1. `## Goal`
2. `## Status`
3. `## Decisions`
4. `## Open questions`
5. `## Steps / follow-up queue`
6. `## Next step`

Edit thread bodies in place so they read as current truth. Do not accumulate a chronological changelog inside a thread.

## When To Create A Thread

Create `.fray/<slug>.md` first, before dispatching or doing substantial work, when an effort:

- will take two or more sub-agents,
- carries a human-owned decision,
- outlives the current turn,
- is split off from an existing effort, or
- is explicitly requested as a thread/spike.

One-shots do not need a file. Put loose cross-cutting one-offs in `.fray/backlog.md`.

Research and implementation stay in one thread. Retool the same file in place when research turns into build work.

## User Asks Are Additive

Every user ask is additive. A new request joins the existing queue; it does not supersede, deprioritize, or replace earlier asks unless the human explicitly says to stop or replace them.

When a new ask lands mid-work:

- capture it immediately in a thread or in the owning thread's `## Steps / follow-up queue`,
- dispatch or advance it in parallel when independent,
- use `enqueued` only for a real file/dependency conflict with a named in-flight agent/thread,
- also continue reconciling and advancing earlier asks in the same turn.

Before replying, re-read the current pending list and recent user messages and verify no user ask has evaporated.

## Write Ownership

Only the orchestrator edits `.fray/<slug>.md` and `.fray/config.yml`. Sub-agents must never edit canonical thread files. If a sub-agent needs to persist durable output, instruct it to write a sidecar under `.fray/<thread>.findings/<id>.md`, then fold the signal into the thread yourself.

## Dispatch Discipline

Before spawning a thread-scoped sub-agent, run the dispatch preflight. This is the Codex-side guardrail that validates the thread exists, adds the thread pointer, appends the standard follow-up epilogue, and records the ledger row.

For a thread-scoped sub-agent prompt:

```bash
printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | node .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-dispatch-preflight.mjs \
  --thread <slug> \
  --agent-type <explorer|worker|default> \
  --label "<short task label>" \
  --model "<model if overridden>" \
  --reasoning-effort "<effort if overridden>" \
  --fork-context <true|false> \
  --dispatch-id "<stable id if you already made one>"
```

The preflight:

- denies missing `.fray/<slug>.md` by exiting nonzero,
- ensures the prompt starts with `THREAD: <slug>`,
- ensures the prompt includes `FRAY_DISPATCH_ID: <id>`,
- rejects conflicting pre-existing `THREAD:` or `FRAY_DISPATCH_ID:` lines,
- appends the orchestration epilogue,
- writes `.fray/.dispatch-ledger.jsonl`.

Pass the emitted prompt to the Codex sub-agent spawn tool. Add `--json` when you want the generated `dispatch_id` and prompt as structured output for scripting. For a true one-shot with no thread, do not use `THREAD:`. Use `--dry-run` only when testing the preflight itself; real dispatches should write the ledger.

After the spawn tool returns an agent id/path and any nickname/display name, attach it to the ledger:

```bash
node .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-ledger.mjs attach-agent \
  --dispatch-id "<id>" \
  --agent-id "<agent id/path>" \
  --nickname "<nickname if any>"
```

When you fold the return into the thread, mark the dispatch reconciled:

```bash
node .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-ledger.mjs mark-reconciled \
  --dispatch-id "<id>" \
  --thread-updated
```

`--thread-updated` is intentional friction. Do not mark a return reconciled until the owning `.fray/<slug>.md` has been edited or confirmed already current in the same turn. Chat summaries and local memory do not count as reconciliation.

The `SubagentStop` hook marks the ledger row returned by matching `agent_id`. A returned row has `returned: true`, `returned_ts`, `packet_present`, and, when the packet exists, `packet_excerpt` plus `packet_hash`. If `stop_hook_active` is true, the hook must not continue-loop; it still records the actual packet state and lets the orchestrator-side `Stop` / reminder guards force manual reconciliation.

This ledger is the Codex Fray metadata layer. Do not rely on Codex accepting arbitrary metadata fields on the agent tool. If the active Codex tool schema supports labels, roles, models, effort, service tiers, structured `items`, or `fork_context`, use them; still put `THREAD` and `FRAY_DISPATCH_ID` in the prompt and ledger because those survive compaction, copied prompts, and tool-schema changes.

## Codex Sub-Agent Lifecycle

Codex supports live-agent primitives such as `send_input`, `resume_agent`, `wait_agent`, `close_agent`, and `fork_context` in surfaces that expose them. Use the active Codex agent tools directly when they are available in the current tool list, except `wait_agent`: active Fray work is notification-driven and must not call it. Match the exact schema exposed in the turn; do not invent fields that are not present.

- Spawn a new agent for a new unit of work. A new unit has its own scope, deliverable, verification, and `## Follow-ups` report. Thread-scoped spawns must be preflighted first.
- Use `send_input` for a live agent when new information belongs inside that agent's existing scope, especially when the agent already owns the relevant files. Include the same `THREAD` and `FRAY_DISPATCH_ID` in the added message, state whether this is a scope change or extra context, and require the agent to include the instruction in its final `## Follow-ups` report.
- Use `resume_agent` for an existing completed or paused agent only when Codex preserves its prior context. If the active surface does not guarantee preserved context, treat the follow-up as a fresh spawn and make the prompt self-contained.
- Do not call `wait_agent` in Fray mode. Rely on sub-agent completion notifications, `codex-reminder`, the dispatch ledger, and `send_input`/`resume_agent` when you need to interact with a known live or resumable agent. If a completion notification arrives, treat it as an interrupt: fold that result into the owning `.fray/<thread>.md`, update `## Next step`, reconcile the ledger, and action the next step.
- Use `close_agent` or the equivalent release primitive only after its result is folded. Do not close an agent before reconciling its return.

`enqueued` is not a substitute for live communication. If a running agent can safely receive additional input and that input belongs to its scope, send it. Use `enqueued` for a separate follow-up dispatch that should be visible on the board and start only after a named dependency returns.

## Forked Versus Fresh Context

Codex sub-agents may support a context fork option. Treat it as an execution-context choice, not as a replacement for a self-contained prompt.

- Use forked context when the agent should inherit the current chat's recent decisions, tool results, or live orchestration state and the work is a continuation of the current reasoning.
- Use fresh context for clean-room reviews, adversarial checks, independent reproduction, or any task where inherited assumptions could bias the result.
- In this Codex tool surface, full-history forked agents inherit the parent agent type, model, and reasoning effort. Do not pass role/model/effort overrides when spawning with `fork_context: true`; the preflight script rejects contradictory fork metadata for the same reason.
- Forked context can be slower and heavier than a fresh self-contained dispatch. Prefer fresh dispatch unless the inherited conversation is genuinely load-bearing.
- Always include the codebase map slice, constraints, thread slug, dispatch id, and exact deliverable either way. Forked context is a convenience, not the contract.

## Sub-Agent Rules

Use sub-agents only when Codex policy allows it for the turn, and make each prompt self-contained. Include the relevant codebase map, exact task, constraints, allowed write scope, and expected final report.

For every coding worker prompt, include:

- work on `main`; no branches, stashes, worktrees, destructive git ops, or repo copies,
- other agents may be editing; do not revert unknown changes,
- edit only the assigned files/modules,
- commit small and often when appropriate for the repo,
- finish with changed paths, tests run, `## Fray state packet`, and `## Follow-ups`.

Sub-agents are not deciders. They may fix obvious bugs, but default/security/product/brand/API-config-env decisions route back to the human unless already greenlit. Opinionated implementation needs sign-off first; broad investigation does not.

Background sub-agents are headless. Do interactive/TTY probes in the orchestrator foreground.

## Reconcile Returns

At the top of every Fray turn, fold returned agents before answering new conversational threads:

- update `## Status`,
- move settled calls into `## Decisions`,
- keep only unresolved items in `## Open questions`,
- drain queued follow-ups in `## Steps / follow-up queue`,
- dispatch or resume `enqueued` work whose named dependency just returned,
- update `## Next step`,
- mark the ledger entry reconciled when you have folded it.

A returned agent is not handled until it is folded into the owning thread.

Keep many independent sub-agents in flight when the work warrants it. Fray is a live orchestration loop, not a batch plan: receive returns through sub-agent notifications, update the associated thread, square the result against the relevant docs/policy, and immediately action the owning thread's next step when it is unblocked. If an implementation returns, either dispatch its adversarial review, resume the implementer with review findings, or mark the thread's next blocker explicitly in that same turn. Do not wait to summarize a large batch before acting on returned information.

The forbidden failure mode is "wait-loop mode": call `wait_agent`, receive one or more completed agents, then go straight back to waiting. Fray now forbids `wait_agent` entirely in active Fray repos. Treat any completed return as an interrupt: update the canonical thread first, reconcile ledger when applicable, then decide the next action from the owning thread.

The plugin installs a `PreToolUse` guard for `wait_agent`, but this is a belt-and-suspenders guard because local static docs do not prove `wait_agent` is visible to plugin hooks in every Codex runtime. Never call `wait_agent` while Fray is active; obey returned-ledger rows even if the hook does not fire.

## Plugin Packaging Notes

This is a repo-local internal plugin. It intentionally does not add public `websiteURL`, `privacyPolicyURL`, or `termsOfServiceURL` values unless the plugin is prepared for external distribution; fake public URLs would be more misleading than omission. Local validation should focus on manifest shape, hook JSON, syntax checks, and trusted-runtime hook behavior.

## Model And Effort Mapping

Use Codex model overrides sparingly. When a dispatch needs a tiering decision:

- `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`: scripted/mechanical harvests only.
- `gpt-5.4-mini`: cheap bounded probes or simple edits.
- `gpt-5.4`: supporting cast, test scaffolding, observable differential probes, nontrivial mechanical edits.
- `gpt-5.5`: default for landing code, architecture, subtle diagnosis, adversarial review, and load-bearing judgment.

Do not pass a higher tier just by habit; choose by judgment required. Re-verify cheap-tier load-bearing claims.

## Autonomous Mode

`autonomous_mode: on` means the human is away. Do not ask blocking questions. Make reversible decisions, document them in `## Decisions`, and keep dispatching. Park only genuinely irreversible, destructive, external, published, or human-owned default/security/product/brand/API-config-env calls.

When `autonomous_mode: off`, surface decisions and ask at checkpoints instead of auto-landing them.

## Validation

Use these checks:

```bash
node scripts/fray/index.mjs --validate
node .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-reminder.mjs --json
node --check .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-dispatch-preflight.mjs
node --check .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-ledger.mjs
node --check .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/codex-reminder.mjs
node --check .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/test-returned-guards.mjs
node --check .agents/plugins/fray-codex/hooks/fray-hook-lib.mjs
node .agents/plugins/fray-codex/scripts/test-returned-guards.mjs
```

If you edit this skill, preserve the Fray invariants: `.fray/` is canonical, the board is computed, only the orchestrator edits thread files, thread-scoped dispatches are preflighted, and every returned agent is reconciled.
