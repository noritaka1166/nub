// SessionStart hook (matcher: "compact") — re-seeds nub's load-bearing architecture
// model after a compaction, so structural knowledge is never silently lost. Run via nub
// (dogfood): `nub .claude/hooks/post-compact-reground.ts`.
//
// Why SessionStart and not PostCompact: PostCompact is OBSERVE-ONLY — its
// hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext is NOT delivered to the model (verified against the
// Claude Code hooks docs, 2026-06-14), so the old PostCompact wiring was a silent no-op.
// SessionStart with source=="compact" fires after a compaction AND its additionalContext
// IS injected into the next turn. Robust: never throws.
//
// Why this exists: after a long compacted session the orchestrator once asserted a
// badly-wrong nub<->aube model (treated aube's whole CLI surface as nub's), reasoning from
// stale post-compaction framing instead of the code. This hook re-injects the distilled model.

const grounding = `⟦nub architecture re-grounding (post-compaction)⟧ Context was just compacted. Re-seed the load-bearing nub<->aube model NOW, and re-read wiki/architecture.md + the cited code (and the nub-aube-architecture memory) before asserting ANY structural claim.

- WRAPPING = library embed, NOT CLI passthrough. nub has its OWN CLI (own clap, own verb registry crates/nub-cli/src/pm_engine/mod.rs::ENGINE_VERBS, dispatch crates/nub-cli/src/cli.rs) and calls aube::commands::<verb>::run(typed_opts) in-process as a linked Rust library (aube = path dep, vendored at vendor/aube). No subprocess, no aube CLI. aube's own cli_main + tool-identity subcommands (doctor/sponsors/completion/diag/usage) are DEAD under nub - its CLI/subcommand surface is irrelevant; only the engine run() fns nub calls matter.
- REBRAND: ALL engine output flows through crates/nub-cli/src/pm_engine/present.rs (ERR_AUBE_*->ERR_NUB_*, aube->nub spellings, jdx URLs stripped, exit-code map).
- INSTALL PIPELINE: CAS store ($XDG_DATA/aube/store/v1/files/, BLAKE3 content-addressed) + GVS global virtual store (~/.cache/aube/virtual-store/, on by default OUTSIDE CI). Materialization = per-file reflink->hardlink->copy (aube-linker/materialize.rs; reflink = APFS clonefile / btrfs FICLONE). Graph wiring = symlinks only.
- THREE INSTALL STATES, do NOT conflate: (1) reinstall-IN-PLACE (node_modules present + state-hash match) -> try_install_fast_path short-circuits, ZERO file ops ("Already up to date"). (2) WARM reinstall = warm store + lockfile but node_modules WIPED -> full OFFLINE materialize from local store -> THIS is the headline warm benchmark vs pnpm, and whole-dir clonefile is the lever on it. (3) COLD = nothing cached -> network + minimumReleaseAge cooling -> the ~7MB primer (top-package packument metadata) helps here only.
- wiki/architecture.md is load-bearing BUT its ~line 250 "no own package manager" / toolchain lines are STALE (contradicted by the vendored aube PM). Trust code + the nub-aube-architecture memory over those lines.
- EMPOWERMENT + FRAY: the control surface is the **fray** board + thread files at .fray/ (migrated 2026-06-14 from epics/final-polish/todo.md). Read the fray skill (.claude/skills) + scan the board (\`node scripts/fray/index.mjs\`) + .fray/config.yml (autonomous_mode + state). You are empowered (continuously cut patch releases, push main, create repos, install tooling, land greenlit work); reversible action > freezing; do NOT build an "awaiting-the maintainer" queue from reversible decisions (the maintainer's #1 repeated correction).`;
