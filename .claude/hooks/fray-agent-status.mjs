/**
 * fray — DERIVED agent state. The single shared derivation used by BOTH the Stop-hook
 * liveness helper (`fray-agent-liveness.mjs`) and the board (`scripts/fray/index.mjs`),
 * so an agent's reported state can never drift between the two.
 *
 * THE PRINCIPLE — compute, don't store (the same rule the board already follows for
 * thread status). A thread's `agents:` binding records ONLY immutable-at-dispatch facts
 * (`{id, label}`); it carries NO hand-maintained per-agent `status` field. (A legacy
 * `status:` may still be PRESENT in old frontmatter — it is IGNORED, never trusted.)
 * Every liveness/doneness judgement is DERIVED here from ground truth:
 *
 *   - output-file (`tasks/<id>.output`) mtime → how long since the agent last wrote,
 *   - the THREAD's own `status:` (done/dismissed = terminal) → whether the orchestrator
 *     has deliberately reconciled the thread.
 *
 * There is NO durable per-agent completion signal a hook can read: `.rested-agents.jsonl`
 * records only `{ts, transcript, session}` — NO agent id — so it cannot attribute a rest
 * to a specific agent. "Done" is therefore INFERRED (terminal-or-stale output + thread
 * status), never read from a stored per-agent flag. That absence is exactly why the old
 * hand-maintained `status` field drifted and false-flagged a completed agent as idle;
 * removing it makes that drift class structurally impossible.
 *
 * Derived states (one per dispatched agent):
 *   - 'terminal'       — the THREAD is terminal (done/dismissed). Nothing to flag.
 *   - 'unreconciled'   — output is stale (>frozenMin) BUT the thread is non-terminal:
 *                        a likely-finished agent the orchestrator never folded. THE one
 *                        signal that matters.
 *   - 'frozen'         — output stale (>frozenMin), thread non-terminal, treated the same
 *                        as unreconciled (a stale-output agent IS the unreconciled case);
 *                        kept as a distinct return only for callers that want the wording.
 *   - 'idle'           — output quiet (>idleMin, <=frozenMin), thread non-terminal: poke
 *                        or confirm it's mid-long-build.
 *   - 'fresh'          — output recent (<=idleMin): actively working, say nothing.
 *   - 'unknown'        — no readable output file (placeholder id, never-started): can't
 *                        judge; fail-open (say nothing).
