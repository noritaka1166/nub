/**
 * fray — Stop hook. Fires when the main agent finishes responding (goes idle).
 * TWO jobs, in priority order:
 *
 *   (A) REST-RECONCILIATION GUARD (the #1 recurring failure). A background sub-agent
 *       coming to REST is recorded by the SubagentStop hook (fray-subagent-rest.mjs)
 *       in `.fray/.rested-agents.jsonl`. If any rest has happened since we last
 *       surfaced one, REFUSE to let the orchestrator go idle until it has reconciled
 *       them — fold findings into the thread, drain the queued follow-ups, and verify
 *       the agent is genuinely DONE (a rest is NOT "done": an agent can rest mid-step
 *       and rest repeatedly). This bypasses the cleanup cooldown (rests are urgent),
 *       but is loop-safe: it only fires on rests NEWER than the last time it fired,
 *       and never twice in a row (stop_hook_active).
 *
 *   (B) CLEANUP NUDGE. Otherwise, the original gentle nudge to make sure threads
 *       touched this session reflect current truth — rate-limited by a cooldown and
 *       gated on a thread file actually having been touched.
 *
 * THREE loop-guards (defense in depth): stop_hook_active; a per-concern cooldown/marker
 * in `.fray/.stop-reminder-state.json`; and the activity gate (cleanup nudge only).
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN everywhere: any error / missing file / unparseable input → exit 0
 * (allow the stop). A broken reminder must never trap the user.
 *
 * Config (`.fray/config.yml`): master `enabled` gates it; `stop_reminder: on|off`
 * (default on); `stop_reminder_cooldown_seconds` (default 1800) is the CLEANUP rest window.
